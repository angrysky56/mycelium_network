# Archived Files

This directory contains archived files from earlier development of the Mycelium Network project. These files are kept for reference but are no longer actively used in the project.

The files include:
- Various incremental development versions (`biomimetic_mycelium_part*.py`, `biomimetic_mycelium_p*.py`)
- Older example implementations (`biomimetic-mycelium-full.py`, `fixed_example.py`, etc.)
- Development utilities and scripts (`debug_mycelium.py`, `merge_biomimetic_parts.py`, etc.)

These files represent the project's development history but have been superseded by the more organized implementation in the main project directories.

**Note:** These files are not maintained and may not work with the current version of the codebase.
